#Semantic Analysis (Hindley-Milner Type Checking)

The goal of this project is to finish an incomplete parser and write a semantic checker for a language. 
The input to the semantic checker will be a program and the output will be information about the types of the variables in the program or an error message if there is type mismatch or other semantic error. The semantic checker enforces semantic rules on the input program. The rules constrain variable usage; depending on the type of a variable, some operations on
the variable are be allowed or disallowed.
