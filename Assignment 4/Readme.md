#Simple Compiler

The goal of this project was to give some hands-on experience with implementing a compiler. 
This compiler will read an input program and represents it in an internal data structure. 
The data structure will contain instructions to be executed as well as a part that represents the memory of the program. 
The output of your compiler is the output that the input program should produce.
